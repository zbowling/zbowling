## About Me

He was instrumental in enabling Apple's Swift programming language to run natively on Fuchsia ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/20/16679342/google-fuchsia-os-swift-language-support)).

## Housing Advocacy and Civic Leadership

Beyond technology, Zac is deeply involved in civic engagement and housing advocacy. He is currently an elected Executive Board Member and delegate (ADEM) in the California Democratic Party, where he actively advocates for progressive housing policies. He serves on Alameda's [Open Government Commission](https://www.alamedaca.gov/GOVERNMENT/Boards-Commissions/Open-Government-Commission), promoting transparency and accountability in local government.

Zac is a prominent leader within [East Bay YIMBY](https://eastbayyimby.org/), advocating for sustainable urban development, affordable housing, and zoning reform. His campaign leadership was instrumental in Alameda's Measure A (2019) and Measure Z (2020), both high-profile initiatives aiming to revise restrictive housing laws and allow for more housing.

Zac's advocacy is deeply personal, informed by his own experience of homelessness in his early 20s, driving his relentless pursuit of equitable housing solutions. He has participated actively in legal and grassroots efforts enforcing housing laws across California and is highly recognized for his regional housing leadership, including [suing and winning](https://www.yimbylaw.org/press/hcd-include-jobs-housing-balance) against the State of California's Department of Housing and Community Development for their application of the state's housing laws around the jobs and housing ratio, underestimating the housing needs of the state by hundreds of thousands of units.

In 2021, Zac was among the early founding members of the pioneering Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) at Google. Through AWU, Zac championed labor rights, focusing on unionizing both full-time employees and contract workers, holding tech companies accountable for ethical workplace practices. His leadership and advocacy contributed significantly to amplifying conversations around worker rights within Silicon Valley and beyond.

In 2024, Zac took on a leadership role in the YIMBYs for Harris campaign, organizing a virtual fundraiser that successfully raised over $125,000 to support Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid. This event underscored the growing influence of pro-housing advocates in national politics. Building on this momentum, Zac now serves in a leadership capacity with YIMBY Democrats for America, a national organization dedicated to promoting pro-housing policies within the Democratic Party.

His leadership and advocacy efforts have garnered past endorsements from influential leaders, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Assemblymember Mia Bonta, Alameda Mayor Marilyn Ezzy Ashcraft, and many other East Bay city councilmembers and unions.
