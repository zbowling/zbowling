## About Me

I'm a software engineer, housing advocate, and civic leader based in Alameda, California. With over two decades of experience in technology and public advocacy, I work at the intersection of software engineering, open-source contributions, and grassroots political engagement.

## Work Experience

I'm currently a Staff AI Software Engineer at [**Meta**](https://www.meta.com/), where I'm spearheading the development of AI-powered developer tools at Meta's Reality Labs for Horizon OS, Quest VR, and wearables. Prior to Meta, I worked at [**Modular**](https://www.modular.com/) on AI software and high-performance machine learning infrastructure. Before that, I was part of Google's [**Fuchsia OS**](https://fuchsia.dev/) project, where I worked on system libraries, drivers, toolchains, and a new Bluetooth stack. I helped enable Apple's Swift programming language to run natively on Fuchsia ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/20/16679342/google-fuchsia-os-swift-language-support)).

I'm a former startup founder and have held senior engineering positions at several technology companies, including [**Apportable (acquired by Google)**](https://venturebeat.com/2016/08/18/google-secretly-acqui-hired-mobile-app-development-startup-apportable/), [**SeatMe (acquired by Yelp)**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbowling), [**doubleTwist**](https://www.doubletwist.com/), [**Texas Instruments**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbowling), and [**Match.com**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbowling).

### Specializations

* Operating systems and compiler development
* Cross-platform development for desktop, embedded, and mobile platforms
* Fullstack Rust, Swift, C/C++, Zig, and Python
* Packaging, distribution, and deployment of software
* Security and performance optimization
* Developer evangelism and community engagement
* Building startups

## Housing Advocacy and Civic Leadership

Beyond technology, I'm involved in civic engagement and housing advocacy. I'm currently an elected Executive Board Member and delegate (ADEM) in the California Democratic Party, where I advocate for progressive housing policies. I serve on Alameda's [Open Government Commission](https://www.alamedaca.gov/GOVERNMENT/Boards-Commissions/Open-Government-Commission), promoting transparency and accountability in local government.

I'm a leader within [East Bay YIMBY](https://eastbayyimby.org/), advocating for sustainable urban development, affordable housing, and zoning reform. I helped lead campaigns for Alameda's Measure A (2019) and Measure Z (2020), both initiatives that aimed to revise restrictive housing laws and allow for more housing.

My advocacy is personal, informed by my own experience of homelessness in my early 20s. I've participated in legal and grassroots efforts enforcing housing laws across California, including [suing and winning](https://www.yimbylaw.org/press/hcd-include-jobs-housing-balance) against the State of California's Department of Housing and Community Development for their application of the state's housing laws around the jobs and housing ratio, which had underestimated the housing needs of the state by hundreds of thousands of units.

In 2021, I was among the early founding members of the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) at Google. Through AWU, I worked on labor rights, focusing on unionizing both full-time employees and contract workers, and holding tech companies accountable for ethical workplace practices.

In 2024, I took on a leadership role in the YIMBYs for Harris campaign, organizing a virtual fundraiser that raised over $125,000 to support Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid. I now serve in a leadership capacity with YIMBY Democrats for America, a national organization dedicated to promoting pro-housing policies within the Democratic Party.
