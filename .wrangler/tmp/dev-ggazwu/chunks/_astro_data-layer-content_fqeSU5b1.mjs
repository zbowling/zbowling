capabilities.\n\n## Key Features\n\n* **TypeScript Code Generation**: Automatically generates TypeScript type definitions for all discovered tools from child MCP servers\n* **Sandboxed Execution**: Executes TypeScript code in a secure sandbox with access to all discovered tool functions\n* **Multi-Tool Operations**: Enables complex workflows that combine multiple tools in a single code execution\n* **Upstream Server Integration**: Supports integration with official upstream MCP servers (filesystem, memory, sqlite, github, brave-search, fetch)\n* **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with stack traces and recovery mechanisms\n\n## Use Cases\n\n* **Multi-File Operations**: Read and process multiple files in a single code execution\n* **Data Transformation**: Process data between tool calls without LLM intervention\n* **Conditional Logic**: Make decisions based on tool results\n* **Error Recovery**: Handle errors gracefully without aborting entire workflows\n* **Cross-Server Workflows**: Combine tools from multiple MCP servers in unified workflows\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n* TypeScript 5.7+\n* Node.js 18+\n* MCP TypeScript SDK 1.20+\n* Zod for validation\n\nThe project has gained **8 stars** and **1 fork** on GitHub, demonstrating its utility for developers working with Model Context Protocol
