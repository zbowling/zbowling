Beyond technology, Zac is deeply involved in civic engagement and housing advocacy.
He is currently an elected Executive Board Member and delegate (ADEM) in the California Democratic Party, where he actively advocates for progressive housing policies.
He serves on Alameda's [Open Government Commission](https://www.alamedaca.gov/GOVERNMENT/Boards-Commissions/Open-Government-Commission), promoting transparency and accountability in local government.

Zac is a prominent leader within [East Bay YIMBY](https://eastbayyimby.org/), advocating for sustainable urban development, affordable housing,
and zoning reform. His campaign leadership was instrumental in Alamedaâ€™s Measure A (2019) and Measure Z (2020), both high-profile initiative aiming to revise 
restrictive housing laws and allow for more housing.

Zac's advocacy is deeply personal, informed by his own experience of homelessness in his early 20s, driving his relentless pursuit of
equitable housing solutions. He has participated actively in legal and grassroots efforts enforcing housing laws across California and
is highly recognized for his regional housing leadership.

In 2021, Zac was among the early founding members of the pioneering Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) at Google. 
Through AWU, Zac championed labor rights, focusing on unionizing both full-time employees and contract workers, holding tech companies accountable
for ethical workplace practices. His leadership and advocacy contributed significantly to amplifying conversations around worker rights within
Silicon Valley and beyond.

In 2024, Zac took on a leadership role in the YIMBYs for Harris campaign, organizing a virtual fundraiser that successfully raised
over $125,000 to support Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid. This event underscored the growing influence of pro-housing
advocates in national politics. Building on this momentum, Zac now serves in a leadership capacity with YIMBY Democrats for America, a
national organization dedicated to promoting pro-housing policies within the Democratic Party.

His leadership and advocacy efforts have garnered past endorsements from influential leaders, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta,
Assemblymember Mia Bonta, Alameda Mayor Marilyn Ezzy Ashcraft, and various East Bay city councilmembers and unions.
