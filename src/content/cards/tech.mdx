I'm currently a Staff AI Software Engineer at [**Meta**](https://www.meta.com/), where I'm spearheading the development of AI-powered developer tools at Meta's Reality Labs for Horizon OS, Quest VR, and wearables. Prior to Meta, I worked at [**Modular**](https://www.modular.com/) on AI software and high-performance machine learning infrastructure. Before that, I was part of Google's [**Fuchsia OS**](https://fuchsia.dev/) project, where I worked on system libraries, drivers, toolchains, and a new Bluetooth stack. I helped enable Apple's Swift programming language to run natively on Fuchsia ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/20/16679342/google-fuchsia-os-swift-language-support)).

I'm a former startup founder and have held senior engineering positions at several technology companies, including [**Apportable (acquired by Google)**](https://venturebeat.com/2016/08/18/google-secretly-acqui-hired-mobile-app-development-startup-apportable/),
